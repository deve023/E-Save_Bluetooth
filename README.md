E-Save Bluetooth is a low cost device which turns an electric appliance off if it does not detect presence in its environment for a certain period of time. It can be configured via Bluetooth Low Energy.

This project was developed as part of the Embedded Systems course in the University of Buenos Aires. I designed and implemented a prototype while in my last year of studying Electronic Engineering. I believe anyone with basic knowledge in electronics and embedded software can understand and implement this device. Developing and building this prototype took approximately 20 hours of work spread over 4 weeks.

The idea for this product comes from the fact that having a high consumption appliance on for unnecessary long periods of time can be very dangerous and expensive. In this day and age, itâ€™s of the upmost importance to regulate electrical consumption at home. E-Save Bluetooth was developed in order to diminish negative impact to the environment and also help save money on the electrical bill.

This product stands out from what the market currently offers due to its low cost and diverse functionality. It comes with an innovative feature: a motion sensor to detect when there is no one around in the room and turns off the appliance so it does not needlessly waste energy. In contrast, smart thermostats and smart plugs work only with timers, they do not sense the environment.

Regarding cost, there is a considerable price difference between a smart plug (low-cost: 12 USD) and a smart thermostat (around 360 USD). E-Save Bluetooth conveniently positions itself between them, at a low-cost of 40 USD per unit.
